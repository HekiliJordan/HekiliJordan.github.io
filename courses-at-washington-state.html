      <p> At Washingon State University, I have completed six semesters under the Voiland College of Engineering & Architecture. Throughout my time at WSU, I have learned numerous
        programming languages that include C/C++, Python, C# HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      
        <p>
       As I further my career as a computer science student my hope is to intern at places that will not only be able to help grow my skills in front end developing, but also
      to grow my skills as a person. <!-- come back to this -->
